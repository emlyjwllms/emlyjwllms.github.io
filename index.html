            I'm currently exploring how to make the immersed boundary (IB) method higher order as it is applied to
            viscous, incompressible Navier Stokes equations, which are spatially discretized using the method of lines.
            I'm employing the immersed boundary smooth extension method to accomplish this goal.
        </p>
        <p>
            The immersed boundary smooth extension (IBSE) method poses a higher-order partial differential equation outside of the physical domain, with boundary conditions matching the exact solution,
            leading to high-order accuracy. The first figure below highlights how, for generic problems, the IB method produces discretizations that are only first-order accurate in the vicinity of domain boundaries or 
            fluid-structure interfaces. However, the process of making the domain boundary forcing function result in a continuous function across the 
            entire domain, rather than a piecewise, allows the function to be increasingly differentiable, making the solution able to achieve higher-order accuracy overall.

            For Fall 2020, I'm currently using TensorFlow neural networks to fit 3D potential energy surfaces to acquire the reaction rates of the hydrogen cyanide (HCN) system.
            Optimization and regularization are being used on permutationally invariant polynomials with uncertainty quantification to determine the accuracy needed for the diatomic potential fit to be acceptable.

            Machine learning techniques are very powerful in modeling, simulation, and (sometimes) prediction. Different Python packages are available that employ machine learning and neural networks to fit given data.
            Training sets are used to train the modeling algorithm and then applied to fit new data to test the algorithm. For the data sets displayed, the red line represents the results from the trained model and the green line represents the actual solution returned by the function.
            The training set data is generated by adding noise to the set function. The keras library was used in Python for developing and evaluating these models.

            I spent Spring 2020 looking into the relation of dissociation rates to the centrifugal barrier.
            Hypersonic re-entry flight experiences extreme temperatures leading to a state of chemical non-equilibrium in
            the flow. To analyze the state-to-state (StS) kinetics for these flows, we propose to fit the kinetics data
            using sparse regression techniques. The advantages of obtaining an expression includes providing an insight
            into the relation of dissociation via various levels to the centrifugal barrier and arriving at a
            physics-informed grouping strategy to reduce the dimension of the kinetics system. This would further aid in
            modeling the reactions that take place in the flow in a computationally efficient way.
        </p>
        <p>
            Fitting the kinetics data required the use of the MATLAB curve-fitting toolbox. Messing with the different
            parameters yielded a variety of different initial results, with more accurate results coming from using
            sparse regression techniques.

            Looking at the correlation between the dissociation rates and the rotational and vibrational quantum numbers
            also
            was able to be visually represented using contour plots with an accurate line of best fit:

            Future research will be devoted towards analyzing the relations between other parameters as different
            variables
            impact the dissociation rates. This research shows that these rates are primarily governed by rotation,
            which
            previous studies in this field commonly neglect for simplicity. Once we can understand the extent that
            rotation affects
            the dissociation rates, these models can be used for various applications in computational fluid dynamics.

        <b>Grainger Engineering First-Year Experience</b>
        <p>
            I also served as one of two Head Engineering Learning Assistants for the GFX administration team.
            As Head ELA, I oversaw and managed all of the other ELAs within the entire college, while
            also modifying lesson guides and implementing new curriculum standards. I adjusted the course curriculum to account for the extension of ENG 100 from an 8-week course to full-semester course, placing an added emphasis on building good study habits, practicing time management, and making friends in a virtual learning environment.

            I was also a lead tutor on the leadership team for CARE, where I helped oversee and manage all 50+ tutors and peer advisors, while also holding my own walk-in hours twice a week.
            I also led the Math 241 (Calc 3) review team, modifying the exam review worksheets to adhere to 6 mini-exams for this semester rather than the traditional 3 midterms and final exam.
            In the past, I led the PHYS 212 (Electricity and Magnetism) and Math 285 (Intro to Differential Equations) review teams.

        <h3>Industry Experience</h3>
        <b>The Boeing Company</b>
        <p>
            I interned at Boeing in the summer of 2020 virtually as a design automation intern working within the digital and array space electronics product design group.
            Working remotely for the Boeing Satellite Development Center headquartered in El Segundo, CA,
            under Boeing Defense, Space &amp; Security (BDS) was a challenge initially, but I was quickly integrated with the rest of the team and was able to exceed the performance expectations my manager had set for me. The work I did on my project is currently set to put my team a year ahead of schedule, and the tool I developed was implemented fully as part of the analysis and review process.
            I was hired through the Engineering Accelerated Hiring Initiative (EAHI) Program.

        <b>CU Aerospace</b>
        <p>
            My summer of 2019 was spent on campus, where I worked on a collaborative project between LASSI and CU Aerospace.
            I served as a liaison between on-site and campus lab teams working on a joint payload project where I helped to lead procedural
            development processes for thermal vacuum and vibrational testing for the monofilament vaporization propulsion (MVP) thruster system.

        <b>GE Aviation</b>
        <p>
            I interned at GE as a product operations intern the summer after my freshman year.
            At GE, I executed technical solutions with cross-functional global teams in time-sensitive cases involving changes in design with outdated tools and spare parts.
            I also reallocated 300+ fan blades in spares inventory to usable parts kitted for application on the assembly line, expediting the development of 20 affected engines.

        <p>
            I served as President of WIA for two consecutive years. Our organization has grown substantially
            throughout my years on the executive board. With a current board of 10+ members, we have a ton of different professional conferences and industry visit trips in the planning stages, as well as virtual outreach activities and professional development workshops for this upcoming semester.

            I'm previous President of SatDev, an organization within the Department
            of Aerospace Engineering that focuses on recruitment and retention of undergraduate researchers within LASSI.
            I introduced the idea of having interest groups with mentors to facilitate the learning and development of technical skills for our
            membership of 300+, eventually leading to the creation of AE 199 SAT.
