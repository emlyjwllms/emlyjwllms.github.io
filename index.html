            I'm currently exploring how to make the immersed boundary (IB) method higher order as it is applied to
            viscous, incompressible Navier Stokes equations, which are spatially discretized using the method of lines.
            I'm developing an algorithm that adheres to the immersed boundary smooth extension method to accomplish this goal.
        </p>
        <p>
            The immersed boundary smooth extension (IBSE) method poses a higher-order partial differential equation outside of the physical domain, with boundary conditions matching the exact solution,
            leading to high-order accuracy. The first figure below highlights how, for generic problems, the IB method produces discretizations that are only first-order accurate in the vicinity of domain boundaries or 
            fluid-structure interfaces. However, the process of making the domain boundary forcing function result in a continuous function across the 
            entire domain, rather than a piecewise, allows the function to be increasingly differentiable, making the solution able to achieve higher-order accuracy overall.

            For Summer 2020, I'm currently using TensorFlow neural networks to fit 3D potential energy surfaces to acquire the reaction rates of the hydrogen cyanide (HCN) system.
            Optimization and regularization are being used on permutationally invariant polynomials with uncertainty quantification to determine the accuracy needed for the diatomic potential fit to be acceptable.
        </p>
        <p>
            I spent Spring 2020 looking into the relation of dissociation rates to the centrifugal barrier.
            Hypersonic reentry flight experiences extreme temperatures leading to a state of chemical non-equilibrium in
            the flow. To analyze the state-to-state (StS) kinetics for these flows, we propose to fit the kinetics data
            using sparse regression techniques. The advantages of obtaining an expression includes providing an incite
            into the relation of dissociation via various levels to the centrifugal barrier and arriving at a
            physics-informed grouping strategy to reduce the dimension of the kinetics system. This would further aid in
            modeling the reactions that take place in the flow in a computationally efficient way.
        </p>
        <p>
            Fitting the kinetics data required the use of the MATLAB curve-fitting toolbox. Messing with the different
            parameters yielded a variety of different initial results, with more accurate results coming from using
            sparse regression techniques.

            Looking at the correlation between the dissociation rates and the rotational and vibrational quantum numbers
            also
            was able to be visually represented using contour plots with an accurate line of best fit:

        <p>
            Future research will be devoted towards analyzing the relations between other parameters as different
            variables
            impact the dissociation rates. This research shows that these rates are primarily governed by rotation,
            which
            previous studies in this field commonly neglect for simplicity. Once we can understand the extent that
            rotation affects
            the dissociation rates, these models can be used for various applications in computational fluid dynamics.

        <h3>Industry Experience</h3>
        <b>The Boeing Company</b>
        <p>
            I'm currently interning at Boeing as a design automation intern working within the digital and array space electronics product design group.
            I'm working virtually for the Boeing Satellite Development Center headquartered in El Segundo, CA,
            under Boeing Defense, Space &amp; Security (BDS).
            I was hired through the Engineering Accelerated Hiring Initiative (EAHI) Program.

        <b>CU Aerospace</b>
        <p>
            My summer of 2019 was spent on campus, where I worked on a collaborative project between LASSI and CU Aerospace.
            I served as a liaison between on-site and campus lab teams working on a joint payload project where I helped to lead procedural
            development processes for thermal vacuum and vibrational testing for the monofilament vaporization propulsion (MVP) thruster system.

        <b>GE Aviation</b>
        <p>
            I interned at GE as a product operations intern the summer after my freshman year.
            At GE, I executed technical solutions with cross-functional global teams in time-sensitive cases involving changes in design with outdated tools and spare parts.
            I also reallocated 300+ fan blades in spares inventory to usable parts kitted for application on the assembly line, expediting the development of 20 affected engines.

        <b>KIE Web Development & Droid-Pixel</b>
        <p>
            In my free time, I like to make websites by coding HTML/CSS to develop personal and professional websites for my friends and others.
            I recently started a site that hosts and displays neat color schemes, some related to different companies, brands, and colleges.

        <b>Women in Aerospace</b>
        <p>
            I'm currently starting my second year as President of WIA. Our once-small organization has grown substantially
            throughout my years on the executive board. We are expecting to have around 10+ board members for the upcoming year
            and have a ton of different professional conferences and industry visit trips in the planning stages.

        <b>Satellite Development Organization</b>
        <p>
            I'm previous President of SatDev, an organization within the Department
            of Aerospace Engineering that focuses on recruitment and retention of undergraduate researchers within LASSI.
            I introduced the idea of having interest groups with mentors to facilitate the learning and development of technical skills for our
            membership of 300+ Illinois engineering students, eventually leading to the creation of AE 199 SAT.
