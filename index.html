        <p>
            199 is currently being developed from an 8-week course to a fully complete semester-long course.
            The course is designed to offer introductory background into the design and development of cubesats as prep for undergrad research within the Laboratory for Advanced Space Systems at Illinois (LASSI).

            ENG 100 opened my eyes to the wonderful world of teaching as I helped guide first-semester freshmen through their first few months on campus.
            I still often meet with some of my students one-on-one to discuss academic plans, internships, and research opportunities within the Department of Aerospace Engineering.

        Laboratory for Advanced Space Systems at Illinois

            At LASSI, I'm currently working with attitude determination and control systems of cubesats.
            In the past, I've managed various teams from mission operations to the entire satellite program after
            initially assisting with structural CAD tasks and systems engineering with proposals and requirements documents.

        <p>
            At NEQRAD, I'm currently working towards fitting the kinetics data of hypersonic reentry flight using sparse regression techniques
            to obtain an expression for the state-to-state dissociation rates in terms of the position of the centrifugal barrier.
            By selecting a large basis set of functions that include exponentials and polynomials motivated by derivations from transition state theory,
            we can model the chemical reactions that take place in the flow.

            I introduced the idea of having interest groups with mentors to facilitate the learning and development of technical skills for our
            membership of 300+ Illinois engineering students, eventually leading to the creation of AE 199 SAT.
            As Senior Advisor, I'll continue to instruct AE 199 SAT and develop the curriculum while serving as a member on the SatDev executive board.
