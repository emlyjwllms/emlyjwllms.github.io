              Wall-modeled large-eddy simulation (WMLES) is utilized to analyze the

              developed by Lockheed Martin at Skunk Works for NASA's Low-Boom Flight

              aim to assess the ability of WMLES to predict near-field noise levels
              under cruise conditions, considering various subgrid-scale (SGS)

              Turbulent flows are ubiquitous in aerospace engineering. External aerodynamic applications have exposed limitations in current state-of-the-art computational fluid dynamics solvers due to the presence of chaotic and multiscale turbulent flows. 
              Wall-modeled large-eddy simulation (WMLES) stands as a realistic contender for turbulence modeling for aerospace applications. 
              However, there remain important challenges of WMLES in the accurate prediction of certain quantities of interest within the stringest tolerance demanded by the industry. 
              In this work, we evaluate the performance of WMLES for high-speed flows and explore new modeling venues. We assess the performance of WMLES for canonical compressible channel flows and a realistic external aerodynamic application, the Lockheed Martin X-59 Quiet SuperSonic Technology (QueSST) aircraft. 
              Additionally, we propose potential modeling improvements to enhance the predictive capabilities of WMLES for high-speed flows.  </div>

              The problem of modeling for turbulent flows is investigated within the framework of information theory. A wall-modeled large-eddy simulation (WMLES) of a compressible turbulent channel flow is conducted using an equilibrium wall model and either the dynamic Smagorinsky (DSM) or information-preserving (IP) subgrid-scale (SGS) model. The IP SGS model is formulated using the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence. The model aims at minimizing the information lost between the probability mass distribution of the interscale energy transfer and viscous dissipation at different scales. The statistical quantities of interest are the mean velocity and mean temperature profiles. It is found that the IP SGS model matches or exceeds the accuracy of the DSM SGS model when compared to direct numerical simulation (DNS) data for the compressible channel.

            Error scaling properties of large-eddy simulation of compressible wall-bounded turbulent flows are 
            characterized. The statistical quantities of interest investigated are the mean velocity profile,
            wall stress, and wall heat transfer. The errors scale as $(\Delta/L)^\alpha Re_\tau^\gamma M^\beta$, where $\Delta$ 
            is the characteristic grid resolution, $Re_\tau$ is the friction Reynolds number, $L$ is the meaningful length-scale to normalize
            $\Delta$ in order to collapse the errors across the wall-normal distance, and $M$ is the Mach number to account for compressibility 
            effects in the channel flow. Different length-scales are used in determining $L$ such that errors along the wall-normal distance are effectively 
            collapsed. The exponents $\alpha,$ $\gamma,$ and $\beta$ are estimated using theoretical analysis and validated through numerical simulations.

              Numerical schlieren visualizations were created in ParaView by contouring the magnitude of the density gradients in the flow to capture the shock waves. The aircraft is also contoured based on the temperature at the surface during flight at cruise conditions. Wall-modeled large-eddy simulations were run through the charLES solver by Cascade Technologies, Inc. The solver integrates the filtered Navier-Stokes equations using a second-order finite volume method in space and a third- order explicit Runge-Kutta method in time. The mesh generator uses a Voronoi hexagonal close-packed point-seeding method with $\mathcal{O}(100\text{M})$ control volumes. An equilibrium wall model is used assuming an isothermal wall with a wall-stress boundary condition with the dynamic Smagorinsky subgrid-scale model.

              Hypersonic re-entry flight experiences extreme temperatures leading to a state of chemical non-equilibrium in the flow. To analyze the state-to-state (StS) kinetics for these flows, we propose to fit the kinetics data using spare regression techniques. The advantages of obtaining an expression for the state-to-state dissociation rates in terms of the position of the centrifugal barrier are two-fold: it provides an insight into the relation of dissociation via various levels to the centrifugal barrier and can be used to arrive at a physics-informed grouping strategy to reduce the dimension of the kinetics system (for example from the order of 10000 to 10). This would further aid in modelling the reactions that take place in the flow in a computationally efficient way. For the purpose of fitting, we select a large basis set of functions that include exponentials and polynomials motivated by expressions derived in Transition State theory. It is followed by a sparse regression over this function basis set to obtain a rather simple looking expression.
